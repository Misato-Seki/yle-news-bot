      <h1>Summary of news for 2025-06-27</h1>
    <h2>Finnish firm prepares to auction luxury yacht believed to have hosted Dmitry Medvedev</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20170008">https://yle.fi/a/74-20170008</a></p><p>2025-06-27</p><p>Kotka Yacht Store plans to auction two Russian-owned luxury yachts. Owners of the Princess-brand vessels have not paid storage fees. The vessels became stranded in Finland in part due to EU sanctions. The company has faced pressure from Finnish and Italian lawyers over its plans to sell the yachting. The owners claim to have sold the yacht to a European buyer, but no proof of purchase has been presented.</p><hr><h2>Rainy, windy weather in store for this weekend</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20169995">https://yle.fi/a/74-20169995</a></p><p>2025-06-27</p><p>Forecasters predict unsettled weather in Finland for early July. Strong winds could disrupt outdoor events in southern and central parts of the country on Sunday. Temperatures in Germany are expected to exceed 35 degrees midweek. The heat wave threshold has been crossed only twice so far this year in Finland, meteorologist Elias Paakkanen says. The average temperature is surprisingly close to normal for this time of year, he says.</p><hr><h2>Climate minister: Solving emissions challenges will be up to next government</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20169911">https://yle.fi/a/74-20169911</a></p><p>2025-06-27</p><p>The government approved Finland’s Annual Climate Report on Friday morning and submitted it to Parliament. In particular, it points to the land-use sector, including agriculture and forestry, where emissions increased in 2024 compared to the year before. The collapse of forest carbon sinks must partly be resolved by the next government, said Sari Multala. The current right-wing cabinet, led by Prime MinisterPetteri Orpo(NCP), has less than two years left in its legislative term.</p><hr><h2>Finland inks deal for country's first defence satellites</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20169938">https://yle.fi/a/74-20169938</a></p><p>2025-06-27</p><p>The satellites will be equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology. The aim is to enhance the Defence Forces' intelligence and surveillance capabilities from space. Data from the satellites will also be available to other national authorities. Iceye has also signed a separate contract worth approximately 200 million euros with the Polish Armed Forces. The agreement marks a significant step in Finland's space-based defence capabilities.</p><hr><h2>THL: Elderly care units cutting staff</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20169914">https://yle.fi/a/74-20169914</a></p><p>2025-06-27</p><p>The government has set the staffing ratio forround-the-clock care for the elderly at 0.6 workers per client, down from the previous minimum of 0.65 per client. The total number of care professionals has decreased by approximately 3,500, or nine percent, even though the number of residents has remained unchanged. The most common staffing ratio in April was between 0.60 and 0.64.</p><hr><h2>If you live in Finland, you're likely to get a mental disorder diagnosis at some point</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20169859">https://yle.fi/a/74-20169859</a></p><p>2025-06-27</p><p>Mental health challenges affect most people at some point – either personally or through a loved one. The most common issues are anxiety and mood disorders, particularly depression. Males are most often first diagnosed around the age of six, and women between the ages of 15 and 19. The high number of diagnoses could be explained by the significant increase in treatment services in recent decades and a lower threshold for seeking treatment.</p><hr><h2>EK: Growing confidence in manufacturing and services; job cuts likely in construction</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20169832">https://yle.fi/a/74-20169832</a></p><p>2025-06-27</p><p>Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) said on Friday that its manufacturing confidence index was up slightly in June. Confidence in the sector sank to –33 in June, down from –30 in May, both far lower than the long-term average of –9. In May, construction sector confidence in Finland was the weakest in the entire EU. On the other hand, confidence in the retail sector weakened in June after a few months of growth.</p><hr></body></html>
