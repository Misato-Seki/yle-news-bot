    <h2>Cash for slime: Towns paying for dead slugs</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20168879">https://yle.fi/a/74-20168879</a></p><p>2025-06-20</p><p>The population of the invasive Spanish slug (Arion vulgaris) has exploded in Finland. Four cities are encouraging locals to get the Crowdsorsa app, which allows residents to earn money by helping remove invasive species. To earn a reward, slug killers must film a video showing the slugs being packed into one-litre containers and disposed of in designated bins. If everything is done correctly, the payment gets credited to the user's account.</p><hr><h2>Cool weather delays summer strawberry harvest</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20168868">https://yle.fi/a/74-20168868</a></p><p>2025-06-20</p><p> cool start to the summer has delayed the ripening of field strawberries in Ostrobothnia. The season is running one — and in some areas even two — weeks behind schedule. Once harvesting begins, the crop is expected to be plentiful. As things currently stand, strawberry picking could begin in early July. For strawberry growers, monitoring the weather is an essential part of the job, says Juha Nikkinen.</p><hr><h2>Government proposes reducing VAT on food</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20168863">https://yle.fi/a/74-20168863</a></p><p>2025-06-20</p><p>The Ministry of Finance launched a consultation round on the proposal on Thursday. The change would apply to food, medicine, cultural and sports-related activities. The VAT rate for public broadcasting would meanwhile rise to 13.5 percent, up from the current level of 10 percent. The proposal is part of the preparations for the upcoming state budget, and if approved, the changes would take effect at the start of next year.</p><hr><h2>Estlink 2 electricity cable back online after months-long outage</h2><p><a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20168861">https://yle.fi/a/74-20168861</a></p><p>2025-06-20</p><p>The Estlink 2 electricity link between Finland and Estonia was operational again on Friday. The link returned to commercial use on Friday after nearly six months out of service. The subsea cable was damaged on Christmas Day. The oil tanker Eagle S, reportedly part of Russia's shadow fleet, is suspected of causing the incident. The damage to the transmission link did not impact the stability of Finland's electricity system, but it temporarily reduced the transmission capacity by 650 megawatts.</p><hr></body></html>
